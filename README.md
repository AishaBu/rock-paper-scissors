# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

### Description
This rock, paper, scissors game was made for the Rock, Paper, Scissors assignment in the Odin Project. The assignment deliverables where to make a rock paper scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While creating this game, I practiced DOM manipulation using JavaScript, and got a better understanding of scope and the use of functions and the return keyword in JavaScript.
